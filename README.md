# E-Learning Design Principles
## Final Project Prototype

This website illustrate an e-learning structure and system on Responsive Website Design for Designers. The course is targeted towards design professionals and design students between the ages of 20-35 years old. The course is intended to be run on an asynchronous e-learning environment.

Students are given short lessons with case studies, then are asked to do a short quiz and a mini practice. The mini practice also requires the student to explain the basis of their answer, which will then be manually assessed by the instructor. The key principles used in this course are worked examples, practice with feature focusing, and self-explanation.

Built using [Goldilocks Approach](https://github.com/designbyfront/The-Goldilocks-Approach). The full presentation for my final project can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XNfgVOY-h6svocoKyUh3CzebzKMFvhyHASEYj8DtJv0/edit?usp=sharing).
